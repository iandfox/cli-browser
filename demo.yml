Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle, al \bl waiting to be served; holding boat-spades, pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his eve \bry sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man's was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm.  \bNo murmur, no impatience, no petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over still further \b his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hamme \br the heavy beating of his heart. And so it was.â€”Most miserable! A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain s \blight but painful appearing yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of \b the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in; and so it came \b to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate. Belated, and not innocently, one bi \btter winter's midnight, on the road running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt the  \bdeadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning, dilapidated barn.
